# Urban Zest Restaurant Web App

**Urban Zest Restaurant** is a fully responsive restaurant website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap 5**.
It showcases a modern and elegant restaurant landing page designed to provide visitors with an appealing experience of exploring the menu, learning about the restaurant, and contacting the team.

## Project Overview

This project was created as a **checkpoint assignment** to demonstrate my understanding of **Bootstrap layout design**, **responsive web structure**, and **component integration**.
The website represents a fictional restaurant — **Urban Zest Restaurant** — that focuses on great food, vibrant presentation, and a user-friendly experience.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Navigation Bar

- Built with **Bootstrap Navbar** for full responsiveness.
- Contains brand name and navigation links (Home, Menu, About Us, Contact).
- The hamburger menu appears automatically on smaller screens.

### 2. Hero Section

- A visually appealing hero area with a **centered headline**, **subtext**, and **“Get Started”** call-to-action button.
- Designed to capture attention with bold typography and contrast.

### 3. Menu Section

- Displays **six signature dishes** using Bootstrap **Cards**.
- Each card includes:

  - A food image
  - A title
  - A short description of the dish
  - A price button

- The grid layout is fully responsive, showing:

  - 3 cards per row on large screens
  - 2 cards per row on smaller screens

### 4. About Section

  - Name
  - Email
