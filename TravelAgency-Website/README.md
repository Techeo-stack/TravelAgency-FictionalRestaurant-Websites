# Horizen Travel Co.

**Horizen Travel Co.** is a responsive travel agency web app built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap 5**.
It provides users with a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate interface to explore destinations, view tour packages, and contact the agency for bookings or inquiries.

## Project Overview

This project was created as a **checkpoint assignment** to demonstrate my understanding of front-end development concepts, responsive design, and the use of the Bootstrap framework.
